# 019-Turtle-Race
- Race between turtles of different colors (uses turtle module)
- There are two slightly different implementations in files turtle_race_1.py and turtle_race_2.py


## When you run the turtle_race_1 or turtle_race_2 file:
1) A popup will appear. Fill one of the six colors ("red", "blue", "green", ....) to guess
which turtle will win.
2) After you press enter, the race will start.
3) If the turtle color that you guessed is the winner, you win else you lose.
4) A message that displays whether you win or lose along with the winning turtle color will appear.
